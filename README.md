# LeetCode_problems
Here is a repo with some basic problems I have solved on Leetcode.com

# 1. [Two sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

# 3. [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/)

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

# 5. [Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/description/)

Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.
- this was noted as a solution that exceeds the time. I have considered shorter cases for string s. My solution seems with Leetcode official solution.

# 9. [Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/)

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

# 12. [Integer to Roman](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-roman/)

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M. For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

# 13. [Roman to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/description/)

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
